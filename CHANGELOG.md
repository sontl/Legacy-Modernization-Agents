## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Multi-Provider AI Support** — Three AI providers now supported:
  - **AzureOpenAI** (existing) — Azure OpenAI deployments with Responses API for Codex models
  - **GitHubCopilot** (new) — GitHub Models catalog via `models.github.ai` endpoint
  - **OpenAI** (new) — Direct OpenAI API access
  - **GitHubCopilotSDK** (new) — GitHub Copilot CLI (`github-copilot-cli`) for stdio-based AI communication, no API keys needed
- **Portal AI Provider Setup Modal** — Browser-based setup for initial configuration:
  - **Azure OpenAI**: API key or Azure CLI (`az login`) auth, auto-discovers deployed models via ARM API
  - **GitHub Copilot SDK**: CLI login or PAT auth, lists models via `CopilotClient.ListModelsAsync()`
  - Assign separate **Chat** and **Code** models; saves to `Config/ai-config.local.env`
  - Auto-opens on first visit when no models are configured
- **Model-Aware Reasoning for ALL Providers** — Three-tier content-aware reasoning adapts per model family:
  - **Claude** → Extended thinking with `budget_tokens` (30%/50%/70% based on effort)
  - **Codex/o-series** → `reasoning_effort` additional property
  - **GPT/Grok/standard** → `temperature=0.1` for deterministic output
  - `ModelCapabilities.Detect()` auto-classifies models from ID string
- **Output Truncation Detection & Recovery** — Safety net for all IChatClient providers:
  - `OutputTruncationException` on `FinishReason=Length`, text-based truncation signals, or unclosed code blocks
  - Escalation loop: doubles `MaxOutputTokens` + promotes reasoning effort with thrash guard
  - Falls back to adaptive re-chunking at COBOL DIVISION/SECTION boundary
- **`ChatClientFactory.CreateFromSettings()`** — Single entry point that auto-selects provider based on `AISettings.ServiceType`
- **`CopilotChatClient`** — `IChatClient` adapter wrapping `GitHub.Copilot.SDK.CopilotClient`
- **`Create()` Static Factories** — All 7 agents now have `Create()` factory methods that auto-route to the correct constructor
- **Model Discovery API Endpoints**: `POST /api/models/connect`, `POST /api/models/save-config`, enhanced `GET /api/models/available`
- **Prompt Studio Multi-Provider Support** — AI Enhance and Re-Score work with both Azure OpenAI and GitHub Copilot SDK

### Changed
- **`CODEX_*` → `AI_*` Environment Variables** — All env vars renamed (e.g., `AI_SPEED_PROFILE`, `AI_LOW_REASONING_EFFORT`, `AI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`)
- **`AgentBase` IChatClient Path** — Replaced hardcoded `MaxOutputTokens=16384` with content-aware `CalculateTokenSettings()` + `ApplyModelSpecificOptions()`
- **All agent initialization** is now provider-aware — uses `ResponsesApiClient` when available, falls back to `IChatClient`
- **`MigrationProcess`**, **`ChunkedMigrationProcess`**, **`SmartMigrationOrchestrator`** — Accept nullable `ResponsesApiClient?`
- **Architecture diagrams** — Updated to reflect portal setup, dual provider paths, and expanded portal features

### Removed
- **`UnifiedAIClient`** — Deleted; model-aware reasoning is now built into `AgentBase` and `CobolAnalyzerAgent`

### Fixed
- **`_runId` Bug** — Three converter agents never assigned `_runId` in one or both constructors
- **`ModelCapabilities` namespace collision** — Fully qualified to resolve collision with `GitHub.Copilot.SDK.ModelCapabilities`
- **Missing `GitHubCopilotSDK` endpoint validation** — Valid SDK configs were being rejected
- **Portal AI blocked by Entra ID** — Prompt Studio Phase 3 now supports `DefaultAzureCredential` and `gh auth token`
- **Temperature not written to portal config** — Respects per-model auto-detection via `ModelCapabilities`
- **XSS protection** — HTML-escapes API-supplied model names before DOM insertion
- **URL validation** — Client-side (HTTPS) and server-side (`Uri.TryCreate`) for Azure endpoints

### Security
- API keys in setup modal stored server-side only (env vars + gitignored config), never in browser storage
- Azure ARM API calls use separate `management.azure.com` token scope

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Business Logic Persistence** — `ReverseEngineeringProcess` and `ChunkedReverseEngineeringProcess` now persist extracted `BusinessLogic` records to a new `business_logic` SQLite table via `IMigrationRepository.SaveBusinessLogicAsync`. Added `GetBusinessLogicAsync` and `DeleteBusinessLogicAsync` to `IMigrationRepository`, `SqliteMigrationRepository`, and `HybridMigrationRepository`.
- **Business Logic Injection into Conversion Prompts** — All four converter agents (`JavaConverterAgent`, `CSharpConverterAgent`, `ChunkAwareJavaConverter`, `ChunkAwareCSharpConverter`) now receive extracted `BusinessLogic` records via `SetBusinessLogicContext()` (new method on `ICodeConverterAgent`). In full-pipeline runs, `SmartMigrationOrchestrator` wires RE output directly into conversion; `--reuse-re` loads the same context from a previous persisted RE run. A shared `FormatBusinessLogicContext()` helper in `AgentBase` formats the context for all four converters.
- **`--reuse-re` CLI flag** — When combined with `--skip-reverse-engineering`, loads business logic from the latest persisted RE run and injects it into conversion prompts. `doctor.sh convert-only` now prompts interactively for this choice.
- **REST API: `GET/DELETE /api/runs/{runId}/business-logic`** — Returns per-file business logic summary (story/feature/rule counts); DELETE removes persisted results to allow re-running RE for that run.
- **Portal: per-run `🔬 RE Results` button** — Shows the business logic summary table for a run and allows deletion of persisted results directly from the UI.
- **RE Results in Portal Chat** — Chat endpoint injects business purpose, user stories, features, and business rules from the `business_logic` table into the AI prompt context. Updated AI system prompt accordingly.

### Fixed
- **Empty Technical Analysis in RE output** — `ReverseEngineeringProcess` and `ChunkedReverseEngineeringProcess` now fall back to rendering `RawAnalysisData` when structured `CobolAnalysis` fields are unpopulated.
- **Total Features always 0** — `BusinessLogicExtractorAgent.ExtractFeatures()` now matches `### Use Case N:` and `### Operation` headings in addition to `### Feature:`, reflecting the actual AI prompt output.

### Changed
- **Dependency mapping runs once per full run** — RE processes (`ReverseEngineeringProcess`, `ChunkedReverseEngineeringProcess`) now include a dedicated dependency mapping step (step 4/5) and store the result on `ReverseEngineeringResult.DependencyMap`. `MigrationProcess` and `ChunkedMigrationProcess` accept a `SetDependencyMap()` call and skip `AnalyzeDependenciesAsync` when a map is already provided. `SmartMigrationOrchestrator.RunAsync` threads `existingDependencyMap` through to both migration paths. Dependency output files (`dependency-map.json`, `dependency-diagram.md`) are now generated in the RE output folder as well as the migration output folder.
- **`doctor.sh`** — Updated `convert-only` to prompt for `--reuse-re`; corrected portal navigation references to match current UI (`'📄 Reverse Engineering Results'`).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Automated Documentation Checker** — New GitHub Actions workflow (`documentation-updater`) that reviews code changes on every push and PR to `main`, identifies missing or outdated documentation, and notifies the responsible author via PR comments or issues.
- **Speed Profile Selection** - New interactive prompt in `doctor.sh` lets you choose between four speed profiles before running migrations, reverse engineering, or conversion-only:
  - **TURBO** — Low reasoning on ALL files with no exceptions. 65K token ceiling, parallel file conversion (4 workers), 200ms stagger delay. Designed for testing and smoke runs where speed matters more than quality.
  - **FAST** — Low reasoning on most files, medium only on the most complex ones. 32K token cap, parallel conversion (3 workers), 500ms stagger. Good for quick iterations and proof-of-concept runs.
  - **BALANCED** (default) — Uses the three-tier content-aware reasoning system. Simple files get low effort, complex files get high effort. Parallel conversion (2 workers), 1s stagger.
  - **THOROUGH** — Maximum reasoning on all files regardless of complexity. Parallel conversion (2 workers), 1.5s stagger. Best for critical codebases where accuracy matters more than speed.
- **Shared `select_speed_profile()` function** — Called from `run_migration()`, `run_reverse_engineering()`, and `run_conversion_only()`. Sets `CODEX_*` environment variables that are picked up by `Program.cs` `OverrideSettingsFromEnvironment()` at startup — no C# changes needed.
- **Adaptive Re-Chunking on Output Exhaustion** — When reasoning exhaustion retries fail (all escalation attempts exhausted), `AgentBase` now automatically splits the COBOL source at the best semantic boundary (DIVISION > SECTION > paragraph > midpoint) and processes each half independently with a 50-line context window (second half begins 50 lines before the split point for continuity). Results are merged with duplicate package/import/class removal and validated for truncation signals. This solves the TURBO/FAST paradox where small output token caps caused repeated exhaustion failures rather than triggering the existing input-size-based chunking.
- **Parallel File Conversion** — All 4 converter agents (`ChunkAwareJavaConverter`, `ChunkAwareCSharpConverter`, `JavaConverterAgent`, `CSharpConverterAgent`) now support parallel file conversion via `SemaphoreSlim`-based concurrency control. Controlled by `MaxParallelConversion` setting (default: 2). TURBO uses 4 workers, FAST uses 3, BALANCED/THOROUGH use 2.
- **Environment Variable Overrides for Timing** — New env vars `CODEX_STAGGER_DELAY_MS`, `CODEX_MAX_PARALLEL_CONVERSION`, and `CODEX_RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_FACTOR` allow fine-tuning of parallelism and rate limiting without code changes.

### Fixed
- **Settings Injection Bug** — All agent constructors in `MigrationProcess.cs`, `ChunkedMigrationProcess.cs`, and `Program.cs` were missing the `settings` parameter, causing `AppSettings` to always be `null` inside agents. As a result, runtime configuration (including environment variable overrides such as `CODEX_MAX_PARALLEL_CONVERSION`) could not be applied, and agents fell back to the default `MaxParallelConversion` value of 1 (sequential). All 10 constructor call sites now pass `settings` correctly so both static config and env var overrides take effect as intended.
- **Hardcoded Rate Limit Safety Margin** — `RateLimitTracker.SafetyMargin` was hardcoded at 0.90, ignoring the configurable `RateLimitSafetyFactor` from `ChunkingSettings`. Now accepts a `safetyMargin` parameter wired from settings (TURBO=0.85, default=0.70).

### Changed
- **README.md** — Added Speed Profile documentation with profile comparison table
- **doctor.sh** — Added `select_speed_profile()` function and integrated into all three run commands. TURBO/FAST profiles now export parallel conversion and stagger delay env vars.
- **TokenHelper.cs** — `CalculateRequestDelay` delay floor lowered from hardcoded 15s to configurable (default 2s, minimum 500ms)
- **ChunkingSettings.cs** — Added `MaxParallelConversion` property (default 1)

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- Line-based chunking fallback for data-only copybooks (no DIVISION/SECTION/PARAGRAPH)
- `SemaphoreSlim` disposal (`using var`) and over-release prevention (`lockHeld` flag)
- Config script injection: `eval` → `envsubst` in `load-config.sh`
- Port cleanup: `lsof -sTCP:LISTEN` to avoid killing client connections

### Added
- Chunking stress test for line-based fallback on large copybooks

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

### Fixed
- `BusinessLogicExtractorAgent` auth: switched to `ResponsesApiClient` (HTTP 401 fix)
- Strict regex for class extraction, preventing AI comment artifacts (e.g., `Completes.java`)

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added
